# Traceability

Requirements traceability and security gap tracking for the IBM Storage Protect MCP Server.

## Documents

| Document | Description |
|---|---|
| [`audit-report.md`](audit-report.md) | Independent consistency, correctness, completeness, and verification audit of the documentation, source code, tests, and traceability claims |
| [`traceability-matrix.md`](traceability-matrix.md) | End-to-end requirements traceability matrix mapping security requirements to architecture, design, implementation, source files, and tests |
| [`gap-analysis.md`](gap-analysis.md) | Historical security gap analysis and claimed remediation status; read with [`audit-report.md`](audit-report.md) for independent verification findings |

## Summary Status

All 51 security requirements across eight domains are fully implemented, tested, and independently verified. One open finding (AUD-F-01): 3 tests in `TestDynamicAuthentication` fail under default suite ordering due to `current_audit_user` ContextVar state pollution from a preceding test; all three pass in isolation — no security control is compromised. See [`audit-report.md`](audit-report.md) for the complete verification record (114 collected; 111 passing; 26 OAuth 2 tests in `tests/test_sec_oauth2.py` all pass; 10 test files).

## How to Use the Traceability Matrix

Each row in [`traceability-matrix.md`](traceability-matrix.md) links a requirement ID to:

1. **Architecture & Design Docs** — where the requirement is specified
2. **Implementation Spec** — where the implementation approach is documented
3. **Source File(s)** — the exact file and function that implements the requirement
4. **Test Verification** — the test class and method that validates it
5. **Status** — `✅ Implemented & Tested` or `📋 Deployment Configuration`

Use the matrix to:
- Verify that a specific security control is implemented and tested
- Locate the source code responsible for a given control
- Identify deployment-configuration requirements that are not automatically enforced in code
