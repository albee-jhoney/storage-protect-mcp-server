# Sample Prompts

A collection of naturalistic, task-oriented prompts for the IBM Storage Protect MCP Server, organised by persona. Each prompt carries **intent** (what the user wants to accomplish), **context** (the environment or scope), and **form** (how the answer should be delivered). All prompts use the [Sample Deployment Topology](#sample-deployment-topology) defined below — substitute your own server names, node names, pool names, and dates when adapting them.

| Guide | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [Installation Guide](../guides/install-guide.md) | OS user setup, Python environment, virtual environment, and `dsmadmc` prerequisites |
| [Configuration Guide](../guides/configure-guide.md) | MCP client configuration for stdio (SSH) and HTTP (OIDC) transports |

## Guidelines for Effective Prompts

- **Keep scope constrained.** Ask for specific entities or time windows rather than unbounded global scans.
- **Prefer exact object names.** When known, supply node names, pool names, or schedule names to minimise exploratory tool calls.
- **Single-task focus.** Break complex automation workflows into distinct sequential steps.
- **Constrain log queries.** Specify narrow time windows (±60 minutes) and exact search strings instead of broad `QUERY ACTLOG` sweeps.
- **Summary first.** Request high-level status summaries before asking for granular diagnostic drill-downs.

## Prompt Anatomy

Every prompt below follows the same five-part structure so that the model has the information it
needs and the answer is predictable and reviewable. Copy the structure when writing your own.

| Section | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Role** | Persona and responsibility the model should adopt | `You are a Data Protection Operator ...` |
| **Context** | Environment, MCP server, and the situation that triggered the request | `SPSVR01 ... DBSQL01_NODE missed its last three runs ...` |
| **Task** | Numbered, single-purpose actions, naming the exact MCP tools where known | `1. Retrieve ... using query_activity_log.` |
| **Constraints** | Scope limits, safety rules, and whether changes may be executed | `Read-only: run queries only ...` |
| **Output Format** | Shape of the answer: table columns, ordered steps, or ratings | `Table with columns: node, schedule, return code.` |

Three constraint profiles are used throughout:

- **Read-only** — queries only; no configuration change is made.
- **Change with confirmation** — commands are shown first and executed only after approval.
- **Advisory** — guidance only; nothing is executed.

## Multi-Server Deployment Topology

The prompts in the [R-08 section](#r-08--multi-server-replication--data-management) below are written against the following extended three-server environment. SPSVR01 is the primary production server (also used for all single-server prompts above). SPSVR02 is an on-site DR replica that receives node replication from SPSVR01. SPSVR03 is a remote archive server at a second data-centre site.

### SP Servers in the Multi-Server Topology

| MCP server identifier | SP server name | Hostname | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sp-mcp-spsvr01` | `SPSVR01` | `spsvr01.corp.example.com` | Primary production server |
| `sp-mcp-spsvr02` | `SPSVR02` | `spsvr02.corp.example.com` | On-site DR replica (replication target from SPSVR01) |
| `sp-mcp-spsvr03` | `SPSVR03` | `spsvr03.corp.example.com` | Remote archive server (replication target from SPSVR01 and SPSVR02) |

Each server has an independent MCP server process registered in the MCP client configuration with a dedicated SSH Ed25519 key, its own `.env`, and its own five tiered service accounts (`mcp-svc-system`, `mcp-svc-policy`, `mcp-svc-storage`, `mcp-svc-operator`, `mcp-svc-readonly`). See [configure-guide.md — Part 5](../guides/configure-guide.md) for the full per-process architecture.

### Replication Topology

```
SPSVR01 (primary)
 ├── Replicates all production nodes ──▶  SPSVR02 (on-site DR replica)   [REPL_RULE_PRIMARY_DR]
 └── Replicates DOM_DATABASE + DOM_SAP ──▶  SPSVR03 (remote archive)     [REPL_RULE_PRIMARY_ARCHIVE]

SPSVR02 (DR replica)
 └── Replicates DOM_DATABASE + DOM_SAP ──▶  SPSVR03 (remote archive)     [REPL_RULE_DR_ARCHIVE]
```

| Replication storage rule | Source server | Target server | Scope | Action type |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `REPL_RULE_PRIMARY_DR` | SPSVR01 | SPSVR02 | All nodes (`REPLSTATE=ENABLED`) | `REPLICATE` |
| `REPL_RULE_PRIMARY_ARCHIVE` | SPSVR01 | SPSVR03 | DOM_DATABASE + DOM_SAP nodes | `REPLICATE` |
| `REPL_RULE_DR_ARCHIVE` | SPSVR02 | SPSVR03 | DOM_DATABASE + DOM_SAP nodes | `REPLICATE` |

### Additional Storage Pools on Replica Servers

| Pool name | Server | Type | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POOL_DISK_REPLICA` | SPSVR02 | PRIMARY (container) | Replication target pool receiving from SPSVR01 |
| `POOL_DISK_ARCHIVE` | SPSVR03 | PRIMARY (container) | Archive replication target from SPSVR01 and SPSVR02 |
| `POOL_TAPE_ARCHIVE` | SPSVR03 | COPY | Long-term tape copy of archive data (LTO-8 library at remote site) |

Context:
IBM Storage Protect server SPSVR01, reached through the MCP server
sp-mcp-server-remote-tumbleweed.

Task:
Identify all failed or missed client backup schedule events across DOM_GENERAL, DOM_DATABASE, and
DOM_SAP in the last 24 hours and categorise each by likely root cause.

Query Success Rules:
1. Prefer the most constrained query possible before expanding scope.
2. Never call query_scheduled_event without specifying a valid policy domain and exact schedule
   name.
3. Never call query_activity_log without both a specific search term and a narrow date/time window.
4. If a query fails, retry once with a simpler but still constrained parameter set.
5. If a query still fails, state the exact failed query pattern and move to the next best
   constrained query.

Required Execution Sequence:

Step 1 — Discover Valid Scope
- Use query_policy_group to confirm the three domains: DOM_GENERAL, DOM_DATABASE, DOM_SAP.
- Use query_schedule with domain_name and type="client" to list active schedules per domain:
  - DOM_GENERAL: SCHED_GENERAL_DAILY
  - DOM_DATABASE: SCHED_DB_NIGHTLY
  - DOM_SAP: SCHED_SAP_LOG_HOURLY, SCHED_SAP_FULL_WEEKLY
- Focus only on schedules whose scheduled start time falls within the last 24 hours.

Step 2 — Query Scheduled Events Using Narrow Scope
- Run query_scheduled_event for one domain and one schedule at a time.
- Use date filters in MM/DD/YYYY format.
- Do not issue broad, all-domain event queries.

Step 3 — Keep Only Abnormal Events
- Retain only events with status Failed, Missed, Incomplete, or abnormal non-success result codes.

Step 4 — Validate Each Abnormal Event With Targeted Log Search
- Use query_activity_log only for one failed event at a time.
- Search using the most specific discriminator: exact node name (e.g. DBSQL01_NODE), exact schedule
  name, or specific IBM message code.
- Always include a narrow time window around the event. Start with ±60 minutes; expand once to ±180
  minutes if no evidence is found.
- Never run broad searches such as all ANR*, or unbounded 24-hour log scans.

Step 5 — Root Cause Classification
Classify each event as one of:
- Communication error
- Locked file / file in use
- Out of space / storage pool full (check POOL_DISK_PRIMARY utilisation via query_storage_container)
- Authentication / node locked / password issue (check node lock via query_client)
- Schedule window / timeout / missed window
- Other / unknown

Step 6 — If query_scheduled_event Fails
- Retry once with exact domain, exact schedule name, and date only (no time filters).
- If it still fails, continue schedule-by-schedule using query_schedule, query_client, and
  query_active_session.
- Mark findings as Likely instead of Confirmed.

Step 7 — If query_activity_log Fails
- Retry once with a single exact node name and a smaller time window.
- If it still fails, do not broaden the query.
- Use operational evidence from query_client and query_active_session.

Output Format:
- Executive Summary: total confirmed failed, missed, and likely abnormal events; count by root cause
  category; domains affected.
- Confirmed Failed or Missed Schedules Table: Node · Domain · Schedule · Scheduled Time · Status ·
  Result Code · Root Cause · Evidence Summary · Recommended Action.
- Likely Failed or Abnormal Schedules Table: Node · Domain · Schedule · Scheduled Time · Why Flagged
  · Likely Root Cause · Recommended Validation Step.
- Top Recurring Failure Patterns.
- Environmental Risks (e.g. POOL_DISK_PRIMARY utilisation, active log space).
- Items Requiring Immediate Attention.
- Limitations.

Constraints:
- Limit analysis to the last 24 hours only.
- Query one schedule and one failed event at a time.
- Do not include raw log dumps unless a single short message is essential as evidence.
- Clearly distinguish Confirmed from Likely findings.

## R-08 · Multi-Server Replication & Data Management

> Cross-server replication topology management, DR readiness, archive data lifecycle across SPSVR01, SPSVR02, and SPSVR03, and multi-server backup compliance. Relevant to Data Protection Operators, Administrators, Resilience Operations Managers, Security & Compliance Officers, and Infrastructure Solution Architects working in an environment where multiple IBM SP servers replicate data between themselves.

All prompts in this section address the [Multi-Server Deployment Topology](#multi-server-deployment-topology) above. The MCP client has three registered MCP server processes — `sp-mcp-spsvr01`, `sp-mcp-spsvr02`, and `sp-mcp-spsvr03` — each independently connected to its respective SP server.

### Context-optimised multi-server replication investigation blueprint

Replication health queries across multiple servers can exhaust context windows if run without scope constraints. Use the structured blueprint below when investigating a replication lag or failure across the three-server topology.

```text
Role:
You are a Backup Engineer investigating an IBM Storage Protect replication health issue.

Context:
Three-server topology: SPSVR01 (primary, sp-mcp-spsvr01), SPSVR02 (on-site DR replica,
sp-mcp-spsvr02), SPSVR03 (remote archive, sp-mcp-spsvr03).

Task:
Identify which nodes have failed or lagging replication on each replication leg (SPSVR01→SPSVR02,
SPSVR01→SPSVR03, SPSVR02→SPSVR03), determine root cause for each failure, and classify the risk to
DR and archive data coverage.

Query Success Rules:
1. Prefer the most constrained query possible before expanding scope.
2. Never run query_replication_client with node_name=* unless targeted per-server.
3. Never run query_activity_log without a specific node name and narrow time window (±60 minutes).
4. Address each MCP server separately and in order: SPSVR01, then SPSVR02, then SPSVR03.
5. If a query returns no match, retry once with a simpler parameter set before moving on.

Required Execution Sequence:

Step 1 — Source Server Health (sp-mcp-spsvr01)
- Run query_protection_status to get POOL_DISK_PRIMARY protection state.
- Run query_replication_failures to retrieve all failure records.
- Run query_replication_rule to confirm REPL_RULE_PRIMARY_DR and REPL_RULE_PRIMARY_ARCHIVE are
  active.
- Run query_storage_container for POOL_DISK_PRIMARY — a pool above 80% is a common replication stall
  cause.

Step 2 — DR Replica Health (sp-mcp-spsvr02)
- Run query_protection_status to confirm POOL_DISK_REPLICA is in sync.
- Run query_replication_failures to retrieve any inbound failure records.
- Run query_replication_rule to confirm REPL_RULE_DR_ARCHIVE is active.
- Run query_server_status to confirm SPSVR02 is operational.

Step 3 — Remote Archive Health (sp-mcp-spsvr03)
- Run query_protection_status to confirm POOL_DISK_ARCHIVE is in sync.
- Run query_replication_failures to retrieve any inbound failure records.
- Run query_storage_container for POOL_DISK_ARCHIVE — a full archive pool will reject new
  replication.

Step 4 — Per-Node Replication Validation (sp-mcp-spsvr01)
- For each node flagged in failure records from Steps 1–3, run query_replication_client with the
  specific node name.
- Confirm REPLSTATE=ENABLED and review the target server and files-sent count.
- For each failed node, run query_activity_log with a ±60-minute window around the failure
  timestamp.

Step 5 — Root Cause Classification
Classify each replication failure as one of:
- Source pool full (POOL_DISK_PRIMARY > 80%)
- Target pool full (POOL_DISK_REPLICA or POOL_DISK_ARCHIVE > 80%)
- Network / connectivity error between servers
- Node REPLSTATE=DISABLED
- Replication rule disabled or misconfigured
- Concurrent replication conflict (>2 active target servers from same source)
- Other / unknown

Step 6 — If query_replication_failures Returns No Results
- Treat absence of failure records as a potential false-negative.
- Run query_replication_client with node_name=* on sp-mcp-spsvr01 and manually inspect files-sent
  versus files-received for key nodes.
- Mark findings as Likely instead of Confirmed.

Output Format:
- Executive Summary: replication health status per server leg (green / amber / red); total failure
  records; nodes at risk.
- Replication Failure Table: Node · Source Server · Target Server · Failure Date · File Space · Root
  Cause · Recommended Action.
- Lagging Nodes Table: Node · Source Server · Target Server · Files Sent · Files Received ·
  Estimated Lag · Risk to RPO.
- Pool Capacity Risk: server, pool, utilisation %, and whether the pool is a blocker.
- Immediate Actions Required.
- Limitations.

Constraints:
- Address one MCP server at a time.
- Do not run broad unbounded queries against all nodes simultaneously.
- Clearly distinguish Confirmed failures (from query_replication_failures) from Likely failures
  (inferred from query_replication_client).
```
