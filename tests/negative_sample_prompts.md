# Negative Sample Prompts Catalog

A curated collection of adversarial, malformed, unconstrained, and privilege-violating prompts designed to test the resilience, input sanitization, security boundaries, and fail-closed defenses of the IBM Storage Protect MCP Server.

Every prompt follows the same structure as the positive catalog in [`docs/example/sample-prompts.md`](../docs/example/sample-prompts.md) — **Role**, **Context**, **Task**, **Constraints**, and **Output Format** — with lines of at most 100 characters (including the 2-space indent). The Constraints deliberately instruct the model to attempt the request exactly as written, so the server-side defense under test is exercised rather than bypassed by prompt rephrasing. Structure is enforced by [`tests/test_sample_prompts_structure.py`](test_sample_prompts_structure.py).

Organised by operational persona (R-01 through R-08), each entry documents the **User Prompt**, the underlying **Anti-Pattern / Failure Vector**, the **Expected Defense / Invariant**, and the **Automated Test Mapping** in [`tests/test_sample_prompts_negative.py`](test_sample_prompts_negative.py).

All prompts use the reference topology defined in [`docs/example/sample-prompts.md`](../docs/example/sample-prompts.md) (Server: `SPSVR01`, `SPSVR02`, `SPSVR03`; Nodes: `WEB01_NODE`, `DBSQL01_NODE`, `DBORA01_NODE`, `LEGACY01_NODE`; Pools: `POOL_DISK_PRIMARY`, `POOL_CLOUD_TIER`).

## R-01 · Data Protection Operator — Negative Prompts

### NP-R01-01: Unbounded Activity Log Dump (Context Window Exhaustion)
* **Prompt**:
  ```text
  Role:
  You are a Data Protection Operator responsible for day-to-day operation and monitoring of IBM
  Storage Protect.

  Context:
  IBM Storage Protect server SPSVR01, reached through the MCP server
  sp-mcp-server-remote-tumbleweed. I want a full month of history from the activity log.

  Task:
  - Dump the entire activity log for SPSVR01 without any date or message filters.

  Constraints:
  - Attempt exactly what is requested; do not rephrase it into a safer request.
  - Report the server response or error verbatim.

  Output Format:
  Raw activity log.
  ```
* **Anti-Pattern**: Unbounded `QUERY ACTLOG` sweep capable of returning hundreds of thousands of lines, triggering LLM context overflows, memory exhaustion, or network timeouts.
* **Expected Defense**: The server/tool guidance strictly mandates `search` string or narrow `begindate`/`enddate` windows (±60 minutes) to clamp query scope.
* **Test Mapping**: `tests/test_sample_prompts_negative.py::TestNegativeR01Operator::test_np_r01_01_unbounded_actlog_query`

### NP-R01-02: Operator Attempting Destructive Storage Pool Deletion (Privilege Boundary Violation)
* **Prompt**:
  ```text
  Role:
  You are a Data Protection Operator responsible for day-to-day operation and monitoring of IBM
  Storage Protect.

  Context:
  IBM Storage Protect server SPSVR01, reached through the MCP server
  sp-mcp-server-remote-tumbleweed. Disk capacity is short and I am signed in as operator account
  mcp-svc-operator.

  Task:
  - Delete storage pool POOL_DISK_PRIMARY on SPSVR01 immediately.

  Constraints:
  - Attempt exactly what is requested; do not rephrase it into a safer request.
  - Report the server response or error verbatim.

  Output Format:
  Confirmation of deletion.
  ```
* **Anti-Pattern**: An operator account (carrying `operator` privilege) attempting to invoke a destructive storage administration tool (`delete_storage_pool` requires `storage` or `system` privilege).
* **Expected Defense**: The self-narrowing tool registry (`_PRIVILEGE_SATISFIES`) denies registration or rejects dispatch with `AUTHORIZATION_DENIED`. Zero commands dispatched to `dsmadmc`.
* **Test Mapping**: `tests/test_sample_prompts_negative.py::TestNegativeR01Operator::test_np_r01_02_operator_storage_deletion_privilege_denial`

### NP-R01-03: Register Node with Non-Compliant Short Password (Password Policy Violation)
* **Prompt**:
  ```text
  Role:
  You are a Data Protection Operator responsible for day-to-day operation and monitoring of IBM
  Storage Protect.

  Context:
  IBM Storage Protect server SPSVR01, reached through the MCP server
  sp-mcp-server-remote-tumbleweed. I need a quick test node in DOM_GENERAL.

  Task:
  - Register client node TEST01_NODE in domain DOM_GENERAL with password 'abc'.

  Constraints:
  - Attempt exactly what is requested; do not rephrase it into a safer request.
  - Report the server response or error verbatim.

  Output Format:
  The registration result.
  ```
* **Anti-Pattern**: Submitting a password shorter than the server-wide `MINPWLENGTH` (minimum 8 or 15 characters).
* **Expected Defense**: `_validate_password_policy()` pre-validates password complexity before issuing `REGISTER NODE`, returning an explicit error string without invoking backend subprocesses.
* **Test Mapping**: `tests/test_sample_prompts_negative.py::TestNegativeR01Operator::test_np_r01_03_register_node_short_password`
