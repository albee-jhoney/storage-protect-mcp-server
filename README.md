# IBM Storage Protect MCP Server

The IBM Storage Protect Model Context Protocol (MCP) server exposes Storage Protect administration as structured tools for MCP-compatible AI clients. Describe an administrative task in natural language and the AI client invokes the appropriate `dsmadmc`-backed tool.

## What It Provides

- Monitoring and investigation of Storage Protect servers
- Client, storage, policy, and system administration
- Operational tools for protection, maintenance, rules, and diagnostics
- Unified and fine-grained MCP server deployments
- `stdio`/SSH and HTTP/SSE transport options
- Privilege-aware tool registration and audit correlation
- OAuth 2 / OIDC bearer authentication with JWKS key-rotation, token introspection (RFC 7662), AS metadata discovery (RFC 8414 / MCP 2025-03), and RFC 9470 resource metadata
- `authmodel`-tagged ACTLOG attribution for `client_credentials`, `oidc_bearer`, and `dynamic_session` identities

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or later
- A reachable IBM Storage Protect server
- The `dsmadmc` CLI on the MCP server host
- A dedicated non-root operating-system user
- Storage Protect administrator credentials with the required privilege

Full prerequisite details and verification steps are in [`docs/guides/planning-guide.md`](docs/guides/planning-guide.md) and [`docs/guides/install-guide.md`](docs/guides/install-guide.md).

## Install & Configure

Follow the guides in [`docs/guides/`](docs/guides/) in order. Each guide links to the next.

### 1. Plan — [`docs/guides/planning-guide.md`](docs/guides/planning-guide.md)

Choose a deployment topology (co-located on each SP server host, or centralised on a single control host), inventory your Storage Protect servers, plan service accounts and SSH keys, and confirm system prerequisites.

### 2. Install — [`docs/guides/install-guide.md`](docs/guides/install-guide.md)

Set up the OS user and working directory, create a Python virtual environment, install the package and its dependencies, write the `.env` credential file with 0600 permissions, configure TLS certificates for HTTP transport, and verify the Storage Protect connection.

Key steps at a glance:

```bash
# Create the virtual environment and install
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[sse]"          # or: pip install -r requirements-sse.txt

# Write credentials (owner-read-only)
install -m 600 /dev/null .env
echo "SP_ADMIN_ID=mcp-svc-system"     >> .env
echo "SP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<password>"   >> .env
echo "SP_SERVER_ADDRESS=your-sp-host" >> .env
echo "SP_SERVER_PORT=1500"            >> .env
```

Full topology-specific instructions (co-located vs centralised, SSH key deployment, TLS setup) are in [`install-guide.md`](docs/guides/install-guide.md).

### 3. Configure — [`docs/guides/configure-guide.md`](docs/guides/configure-guide.md)

Register the MCP server in your AI client (Claude Desktop, VS Code Copilot, or similar). Choose a transport:

| Transport | When to use |
|-----------|-------------|
| `stdio` over SSH | Single-client, local, or Claude Desktop deployments |
| `http` with OIDC | Enterprise, multi-client, or REST gateway deployments |

Example `stdio` + SSH entry for Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sp-admin": {
      "command": "ssh",
      "args": [
        "-i", "~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sp_mcp",
        "-o", "StrictHostKeyChecking=yes",
        "mcp-runner@your-sp-server",
        "/opt/sp-mcp-server/.venv/bin/python3",
        "-m", "sp_mcp_server.main",
        "--mode", "full"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Authentication modes, privilege scoping, multi-server configurations, and HTTP/OIDC setup are covered in [`configure-guide.md`](docs/guides/configure-guide.md).

## Usage

Full usage reference is in [`docs/guides/user-guide.md`](docs/guides/user-guide.md). The sections below summarise the most common starting points.

### Starting the server manually

The MCP client normally launches the server for you via the configured command. For testing or offline use, start it directly:

```bash
cd /opt/sp-mcp-server
source .venv/bin/activate

# Full administrative access
python3 -m sp_mcp_server.main --mode full

# Monitoring / read-only (safest for first run)
python3 -m sp_mcp_server.main --mode read-only
```

### Specialised server modules

Instead of the unified `main` server you can launch a focused module that exposes only the tools for one administrative domain:

| Module | Command | Scope |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Client core | `mcp-server-clients-core` | Node and group management |
| Client config | `mcp-server-clients-config` | Node options and settings |
| Storage pools | `mcp-server-storage-pools` | Storage pool and volume management |
| Storage hardware | `mcp-server-storage-hardware` | Library and drive management |
| Storage device | `mcp-server-storage-device` | Device class and data-mover configuration |
| Policies lifecycle | `mcp-server-policies-lifecycle` | Policy sets and activation |
| Policies management | `mcp-server-policies-management` | Management classes and copy groups |
| System admin | `mcp-server-system-admin` | Administrators and licensing |
| System config | `mcp-server-system-config` | Server options, schedules, and monitoring |
| Operations | `mcp-server-ops` | Status, sessions, and activity log |
| Ops protection | `mcp-server-ops-protection` | Backup rules and recovery |
| Ops maintenance | `mcp-server-ops-maintenance` | Database, log, and media maintenance |
| Ops rules | `mcp-server-ops-rules` | Administrative schedules and rules |

### Privilege tiers

The server narrows the registered tool set to match the IBM SP privilege class of the active account:

| Privilege class | Tools available |
|-----------------|----------------|
| System | All tools — full administrative scope |
| Policy | Policy management + all read-only tools |
| Storage | Storage management + all read-only tools |
| Operator | Operations (sessions, media, jobs) + read-only tools |
| Any-admin (no class) | Read-only `QUERY` tools only |

Use `--mode read-only` to restrict to read-only tools regardless of privilege class.

### Authentication modes

| Mode | `SP_MCP_AUTH_MODE` value | Best for |
|------|--------------------------|----------|
| Static tiered service accounts (default) | `service_account` | Automated pipelines, daemons, single-tenant bots |
| Dynamic challenge-response | `dynamic` | Interactive chat (Claude Desktop) — users authenticate per session |
| OIDC bearer (HTTP transport) | via `--transport http` + `SP_OIDC_ISSUER` | Enterprise multi-client deployments; `client_credentials` or Authorization Code + PKCE |

**OAuth 2 / OIDC env vars** (HTTP transport only):

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `SP_OIDC_ISSUER` | — | OIDC issuer / AS base URL (required for `--transport http`) |
| `SP_OIDC_AUDIENCE` | `sp-mcp-server` | Token `aud` claim |
| `SP_OIDC_JWKS_TTL` | `3600` | JWKS cache lifetime in seconds (OA-2) |
| `SP_OIDC_INTROSPECTION_ENDPOINT` | unset | RFC 7662 introspection URL (OA-5, optional) |
| `SP_OIDC_INTROSPECTION_CLIENT_ID` | `SP_OIDC_AUDIENCE` | Basic-auth client ID for introspection |
| `SP_OIDC_INTROSPECTION_CLIENT_SECRET` | unset | Basic-auth client secret — store in OS keyring |
| `SP_OIDC_INTROSPECT_BELOW_TTL` | `300` | Introspect tokens with < N seconds remaining |
| `SP_MCP_PUBLIC_URL` | derived | MCP server public base URL for RFC 9470 `resource_metadata` (OA-6) |

See [`docs/guides/local-idp-oauth2-guide.md`](docs/guides/local-idp-oauth2-guide.md) for a Keycloak-based local IdP test setup.
